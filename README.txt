assignment4.py: runs and generates all plots for the report, creates problems from Gym and MDP, and has PI, VI, and QL run on all experiments


packages used:
https://github.com/Farama-Foundation/Gymnasium - source for Frozen Lake
https://pymdptoolbox.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api/mdptoolbox.html - source for Forest Management

create folder "plots" with 3 subfolders: "forest" "frozen_6" "frozen_16"

Some PI or QL runs start to catch and freeze up, restarting them usually works out
